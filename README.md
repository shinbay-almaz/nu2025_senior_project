## Chapter¬†1 ‚Äì The Idea üí°

When we were seeking a senior‚Äëproject topic, our **lovely Professor Fazli** (with the warmest will) presented an idea: **Create the SMARTEST ROBOT DOG.**  
(It eventually shapeshifted into _WALL‚ÄëE on legs_‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs Chapter¬†3.)

In short: **Build something fun _(but time-consuming)_ and interesting _(but very time-consuming)_, with limitless parts budget.**

## Chapter¬†2 ‚Äì Why We Chose It & Why You Should Too ü§î

### 1. A Lot of Experience in Different Fields

No need to be an expert; you‚Äôll learn as you go. All you need is passion, love for experimentation, and a little (BIG) help from ChatGPT.

**1) 3D Printing**  
‚Ä¢ None of us had printed before, yet we printed and built WALL‚ÄëE. You‚Äôll get the physical bot from the professor (upgrade it, break it, print spares ‚Äì go wild).

**2) Programming the Robot**  
‚Ä¢ Raspberry¬†Pi¬†5 + Arduino = brain & nerves. We scripted various funky moves triggered by voice.

**3) AI and Software**  
‚Ä¢ _Face‚ÄØRecognition_ ‚Äì Coral AI, lightweight enough for Raspberry Pi.  
‚Ä¢ _Voice Recognition_ ‚Äì detects & recognizes voice commands, then makes WALL‚ÄëE play cute sounds.  
‚Ä¢ _Sound Triangulation_ ‚Äì Microphone array converts sound to angles; the bot turns toward whoever yells ‚ÄúWALL‚ÄëE!‚Äù

### 2. Lovely Professor & Legend Aibek

1. Super‚Äëfriendly supervisors who listen, feedback, and rescue you when stuck. Prof.¬†Fazli can summon hardware gurus at will.
2. **Aibek** is a geek who can solve almost any technical problem, so don‚Äôt be shy to text him at 3‚ÄØA.M. _(He will write back during 3 working days (maybe...))_.  
   _(P.S.¬†Just kidding, sorry Aibek, we love you! You are the best!)_ ‚ù§Ô∏è

### 3. Creativity & Experimenting

You‚Äôre always free to add, remove, or change anything‚Äîjust avoid building Skynet. Great creativity + lots of time = success (time was our nemesis).

If you crave multidisciplinary chaos, helpful mentors, and creative freedom, **this project is for you.** Make It Great Again‚Ñ¢.

## Chapter¬†3 ‚Äì 2024‚Äë2025 Progress üõ†

### 1. Research & Experimenting

70‚ÄØ% of our timeline was ~googling~ _research_. Raspberry¬†Pi horsepower ‚â† workstation, so many off‚Äëthe‚Äëshelf solutions needed brutal adaptation.

### 2. Software Part

- **Face Recognition** ‚Äì See `face_recognizer.py` (based on Coral AI & <https://github.com/bergerda1/PiFaceRecognition>).  
  How‚Äëto run? Check Chapter¬†5. ‚úîÔ∏è
- **Sound Triangulation** ‚Äì After much caffeine, we bought a mic array that spits out angles. Works like a charm (except when it doesn‚Äôt). üîß
- **Voice Recognition** ‚Äì [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai/). Good luck üòâ. Maybe beg the prof for a paid plan if the free tier croaks.

### 3. Hardware Part

We printed & assembled WALL‚ÄëE following this glorious guide:  
<https://wired.chillibasket.com/3d-printed-wall-e/>  
Break something? Re‚Äëprint, re‚Äëscrew, repeat. Good luck!!!

_Other two chapters will be written by another guy, therefore it may be boring. I wish you luck with this project and hope it will give you not only good grades, but epic experience. GHLF!!!_ ‚Äì **Raiymbek**

## Chapter¬†4 ‚Äì Areas for Improvement üîß

### Hardware

- **Size Limitation** ‚Äì WALL‚ÄëE cannot fit all project components inside.
  - Use a **larger 3D model** _or_ reduce the number of hardware parts.
- **Structural Instability** ‚Äì WALL‚ÄëE‚Äôs construction is fragile.
  - Remodeling or full rebuild recommended _(time‚Äëconsuming but worth it)._ üõ†Ô∏è

### Speech Detection

- **Accuracy Issues** ‚Äì Rhino Speech‚Äëto‚ÄëIntent is sensitive to noise; accuracy unmeasured.
  - Test in multiple environments (dorm, lab, noisy hallway).
- **Limited Vocabulary** ‚Äì Rhino supports only a predefined set of names.
  - Swap in a better speech‚Äërecog model that runs on Pi _or_ offload via API (adds cloud complexity).

### Movement

- **Lack of Autonomy** ‚Äì WALL‚ÄëE cannot move autonomously or dodge obstacles.
  - Add sensors (ultrasonic, lidar, spicy AI vision) + code brains.
- **Rotation Inaccuracy** ‚Äì Current turns use rough time estimates (~5¬†s per 360¬∞).
  - Calibrate with encoders or IMU for real angles.

### Speech¬†& Movement Combo

- **Motor Noise Interference** ‚Äì Voice commands fail while servos scream.
  - Noise suppression, directional mics, or pause‚Äëmove‚Äëlisten cycles.

### Speaker

- **Bluetooth Drama** ‚Äì BT speaker works only without `sudo`.
  - Go old‚Äëschool: 3.5‚ÄØmm jack or USB.
  - Or figure out non‚Äësudo magic / replace the speaker entirely.

## Chapter¬†5 ‚Äì Mic Array & Arduino Configuration üîåüéôÔ∏è

> _Configure the mic array and Arduino code to make WALL‚ÄëE hear the world and react like a true good boy._

**Links for reference**

- Wall-E repo: <https://github.com/chillibasket/walle-replica>
  - Here you can find anything about Wall-E assemble and configuration
  - instead of motor shield r2, we used l298n motor driver, so use given `L298NMotorController` class in this repo in place of `MotorController` class from the main repo.
  - Wiring is up to you guys, good luck ;)
- Micro Array: <https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-USB-Mic-Array/>

### Requirements

- **Python** <‚ÄØ3.10 (use a virtual environment to stay sane)

### Getting Started

0. **Look into setup**

![setup](assets/setup.jpeg)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shinbay-almaz/nu2025_senior_project.git
   cd nu2025_senior_project
   ```
2. **Add `tuning.py`** from the mic‚Äëarray repo (drop it into the project root).
3. **Install Python modules**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If something is still missing, append it to `requirements.txt` and rerun the command.
4. **Run the main script**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 main.py voice
   ```
   **If it fails:**
   - Verify _everything_ is plugged in (camera, LCD, Arduino, mic array, wires, etc.).
   - Make sure your Python version is **‚â§‚ÄØ3.9.x**.

## License üìú (Just for formality)

MIT ‚Äì because robots should be free (and we‚Äôre too tired to lawyer up).
